            "“The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking.”",
            "“It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.”",
            "“There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.”",
            "“The person, be it gentleman or lady, who has not pleasure in a good novel, must be intolerably stupid.”",
            "“Imperfection is beauty, madness is genius and it's better to be absolutely ridiculous than absolutely boring.”",
            "“This life is what you make it. No matter what, you're going to mess up sometimes, it's a universal truth. But the good part is you get to decide how you're going to mess it up. Girls will be your friends - they'll act like it anyway. But just remember, some come, some go. The ones that stay with you through everything - they're your true best friends. Don't let go of them. Also remember, sisters make the best friends in the world. As for lovers, well, they'll come and go too. And baby, I hate to say it, most of them - actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can't give up because if you give up, you'll never find your soulmate. You'll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because you fail once, doesn't mean you're gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold on, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you don't, then who will, sweetie? So keep your head high, keep your chin up, and most importantly, keep smiling, because life's a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about.”",
            "“It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.”",
            "“If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself.”",
            "“You may not be her first, her last, or her only. She loved before she may love again. But if she loves you now, what else matters? She's not perfect—you aren't either, and the two of you may never be perfect together but if she can make you laugh, cause you to think twice, and admit to being human and making mistakes, hold onto her and give her the most you can. She may not be thinking about you every second of the day, but she will give you a part of her that she knows you can break—her heart. So don't hurt her, don't change her, don't analyze and don't expect more than she can give. Smile when she makes you happy, let her know when she makes you mad, and miss her when she's not there.”",
            "“I like nonsense, it wakes up the brain cells. Fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living.”",
            "“I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I love you simply, without problems or pride: I love you in this way because I do not know any other way of loving but this, in which there is no I or you, so intimate that your hand upon my chest is my hand, so intimate that when I fall asleep your eyes close.”",
            "“For every minute you are angry you lose sixty seconds of happiness.”",
            "“If you judge people, you have no time to love them.”",
            "“Anyone who thinks sitting in church can make you a Christian must also think that sitting in a garage can make you a car.”",
            "“Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and it may be necessary from time to time to give a stupid or misinformed beholder a black eye.”",
            "“The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go.”",
            "“Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?”",
            "“The truth is, everyone is going to hurt you. You just got to find the ones worth suffering for.”",
            "“Not all of us can do great things. But we can do small things with great love.”",
            "“To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.”",
            "“A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies, said Jojen. The man who never reads lives only one.”",
            "“You can never get a cup of tea large enough or a book long enough to suit me.”",
            "“You believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself.”",
            "“If you can make a woman laugh, you can make her do anything.”",
            "“Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving.”",

            "“That's the problem with drinking, I thought, as I poured myself a drink. If something bad happens you drink in an attempt to forget; if something good happens you drink in order to celebrate; and if nothing happens you drink to make something happen.”",
            "“You don’t forget the face of the person who was your last hope.”",
            "“Remember, we're madly in love, so it's all right to kiss me anytime you feel like it.”",
            "“To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable.”",
            "“Not all those who wander are lost.”",

            "“Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.”",
            "“A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment.”",
            "“Remember, if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy, remember what happened to a boy who was good, and kind, and brave, because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort. Remember Cedric Diggory.”",
            "“I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book! -- When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library.”",
            "“There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well.
